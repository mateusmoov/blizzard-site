## Technologies used

|Technology|Version  |
|--|--|
|[ReactJS](https://react.dev/)|18.2.0|
| [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) | 3.2.4 |
| [React Query](https://react-query-v3.tanstack.com/) | 4.20.4 |
| [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) | 1.0.2 |
| [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) | 4.3.2 |


## Usage

Installation:

```bash
npm i
```

Start the server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## What I Learned

- **TailwindCSS** is a great choice if you want to create a faster layout, that was pretty easy to put the configurations and the class names, I had to check the documentation so many times to see how I apply x thing in Tailwind, but it’s completely normal.
- **Zustand** was the pretty one, that framework helps in a easy way to create a global state in React, I had to create a state on my navbar to open and close the sections, because the components doesn’t have a connection between.
- **RadixUI** was the easy way to create a modal, in the case, I grab the react dialog, but the Radix have so many components that you can donwload in your [documentation](https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/primitives/overview/introduction).
- **React Query** is a great lib if you want to make a API call without useEffect, they have so many features that I doesn’t discover yet, but I want in a future.

## Improvements

- [ ]  Make the images load more fast
- [ ]  Make more animations between the games when the section change
- [ ]  The last section was weird on mobile

## What would I do differently

- It was probably better to init the project with NextJS.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, creating the Blizzard Website was a challenging but rewarding experience. Through this project, I had the opportunity to improve my skills with ReactJS, TailwindCSS, React Query, Radix UI, and Zustand. I learned valuable lessons about web development best practices, and responsive design.
